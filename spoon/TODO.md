Todo:
-----

- assignments
- macros
- Add type checking
- Create "object" class containing the file's definitions
	- make it (de)serializable?
- add labels (loopStart:)
	- type of statement
	- also have local scope - local link @ compile time
	- during link, we push the addresses of labels we pass
	- then look them up... may require multi-pass! (unless labels must be above jump)
	- or keep a map of machine addresses to symbols that should have been subbed in, and retroactively sub the label vectors in after passing through the tree.
	- so at parse time, label name's pushed to declarations _and_ statements:
		- declarations to tell the compiler it's in scope
		- statements to tell the linker when it's at the correct address
- more control structures (goto, if, while - these should all translate into NFCs.)
	- start with goto, then if.
	- if: we have a pointer, and this maps to the value we're switching on. (use a variable)
	- expressions/functions can write to this pointer location if they're evaluated inside the if
	- the if instruction reads this location and skip to either block
	- the true block has an instr. at the end to skip past the else.
	- use variables for all the addresses, sub retroactively once addresses are known.
	- have a single loop structure that adds a jump at the end.
	- have a break: specialized goto that jumps past end of loop.
	- while is a loop with an if (){break;}...
- bulk out the standard library
- add comments to tokenizer!
- constant values
- functions in expressions (with results)
	- have a proper return mechanism for user-defined etc.
	- have hardcoded ones like const(8), second(16), first(16) etc.
	- means we need a proper function signature class for return types
