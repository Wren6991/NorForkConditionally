Todo:
-----

- assignments
	- each assignment reads from a location.
	- if expression is a constant, link it in from the constant table.
	- if not:
		- declare a new temporary variable (i.e. allocate some space)
		- evaluate the expression into this space
		- use this address in the assignment
	- use the same strategy for control expressions in ifs, whiles etc.
- macros
- Add type checking
- Create "object" class containing the file's definitions
	- make it (de)serializable?
- bulk out the standard library
- add comments to tokenizer!
- functions in expressions (with results)
	- have a proper return mechanism for user-defined etc.
	- have hardcoded ones like const(8), second(16), first(16) etc.
	- means we need a proper function signature class for return types
- if we assign from a function result, pass the assignment target into the function link routine.
	- this way we can write straight to the assignment target
	- perhaps save this for after everything's working?
	- still probably better for function return location to be decided for caller, more convenient that way
- Use object destructors to give debug information as the stack is unwound: "inside while, inside function main" etc.
	- "defuse" them if the function completes successfully, otherwise they'll print an error message when destroyed.
- Clear up distinctions between what's a value and what's a pointer to a value.
- make linker valtable contain linkvals, so we can have chains of symbols (sym1->sym2->constant)
