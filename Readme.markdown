This repo contains files relating to the One Instruction Set Computer, NFC. It contains:
- A javascript-based compiler for a low-level language, targeted at an NFC machine
- A C++ application for emulating such a machine
- A logisim file containing a possible implementation of an NFC machine
- Implementation notes for this physical machine

Thanks go to Jack for his excellent documentation.x
